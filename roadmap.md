 Next steps could include:

  1. Adding more workflow patterns, such as:
    - Swarm agent patterns
    - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    - Tool creation workflows
  2. Enhancing configuration further with:
    - Support for different configuration formats (JSON, TOML)
    - Dynamic reconfiguration
    - Config validation and linting
  3. Implementing additional utilities like:
    - Improved logging and telemetry
    - Built-in evaluation metrics
    - Connection pooling and caching mechanisms
